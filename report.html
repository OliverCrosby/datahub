                    <h1>Birth of a Data Strategy</h1>
                    <h2>A report on Website Analytics and User Research</h2>
            </div>
            <div id="bodymatter">
                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>As websites go, the data strategy was a small project. Although the design and content of the website were ambitious, the target audience was small. So this report is a bit of an experiment. The goal is to see how much knowledge we can possibly learn from a small web project, focusing qualitatively on the user experience, and to provide some recommendations for future digital projects.</p>

                <h1>Traffic Overview</h1>
                <p>We started collecting data on September 2nd. Since then we've seen 582 'new' users, representing roughly 22% of the total staff at PHAC. We don't know for sure how many of those users were 'truly' unique. There could be duplication from users who used different devices, but also a lack of data from browsers that block tracking scripts. This is a rough count of a small sample size, so put away your graphing calculators: we aren't going to be doing any regression analyses here.</p>

                <p>Instead we're going to look at the patterns and spikes in traffic.</p>

                <!-- <iframe alt="Chart shows daily number of users visiting the website, fluxuating vastly from 0 to 122, and averaging 17" width="100%" height="300" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRQVPGWad09kovWso7dnghqHodo7FUYuI7WwvSjdYFe0ueUEwXrSPnKxMm8eBCf6oCcKmVQkNNSjyqt/pubchart?oid=1134507230&amp;format=interactive"></iframe> -->

                <p>In the chart above you can see that traffic spiked on several occassions. There are a few observations we can draw from this traffic data:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Traffic did not grow steadily. This is to be expected when most visitors are new. In our case only 26% of visitors returned. This isn’t particularly surprising: for most people, once they’ve seen the data strategy they have no reason to go back.</li>
                    <li>Traffic spiked on days when we ran announcements in the Broadcast News thingy. This *could* tell us something about the effectiveness of Broadcast News, but we don’t have anything to compare it to.</li>
                    <li>If you look closely, you can seee that almost nobody looked at the data strategy on the weekend. nobody wants to read about data strategies on the weekend.</li>
                </ol>
