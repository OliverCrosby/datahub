                            <p>We strive to prevent and control chronic and infectious diseases as well as injuries, and we prepare for and respond to public health emergencies. </p>
                            <p>Our actions have been, and always will be, guided by sound data. </p>
                            <p>Our ability to <strong>collect, generate, secure, manage, access, and analyze data is essential to our mandate</strong>, and we recognize that the value of our data will be optimized when they are easily found, readily available, have multiple purposes, unbiased and accurate.</p>
                            <p>From public health notices regarding food-related outbreaks to travel health notices, Canadians rely on PHAC to provide them with accurate and timely information. Our ability to create, collect, and share data effectively is paramount to our ability to provide Canadians with critical public health information. All the while, we are acutely aware of the importance of safeguarding privacy and guarding against bias as we collect, analyze and use our data holdings. </p>
                            <img src="images/Vision-1.png" class="img left" alt="A graphic illustrating the components of quality data.">
                            <p>Our need for and the availability of timely data will continue to grow exponentially in the years ahead. Technology is advancing rapidly, creating <strong>unprecedented opportunities</strong> to integrate machine learning and artificial intelligence into science-based analytics that will improve our ability to generate predictive models for important public health action. There is also a <strong>growing expectation for real-time data that inform analysis for timely decisions</strong>. PHAC is increasingly combining innovative data analytics and visualization tools with traditional epidemiologic research and surveillance methods, transforming our data rich environment into meaningful public health information. This is enabling us to learn more about our public health ecosystem and public policies so that we can support all Canadians in achieving optimal health and reducing health disparities across the country. </p>
                            <p>This <strong>Data Strategy</strong> is designed to be both <strong>aspirational and practical</strong>. Delivering on the strategy will enable PHAC to build a foundation for public health data. When fully realized, the implementation plan will establish clear governance, develop horizontal data infrastructure, adopt innovative approaches, encourage iterative experimentation, prioritize users, and forge partnerships with jurisdictions and external organizations. Foundational to all of this recognition is that our culture must support our staff's development and need for tools and resources so that they can continue to excel at being the fabric of our federal public health organization.</p>
                            <p>Through the actions outlined in this PHAC Data Strategy we aspire to be an Agency that leverages data innovation and modern technical capacity in pursuit of our mandate to promote and protect the health of Canadians.</p>
