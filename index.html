									<img src="images/Vision 2.png" class="img right" alt="An image presenting vision, leadership, partnership, action and innovation.">			
									<p>We promote and protect the health of Canadians through leadership, partnership, innovation and action in public health.</p>
									<p>We strive to prevent and control chronic and infectious diseases as well as injuries, and we prepare for and respond to public health emergencies.</p>
									<p>Our actions have been, and always will be, guided by sound data.</p>
									<p>We are conveners, generators, and users of public health data.</p>
									<p>Our ability to collect, secure, manage, access, and analyze data is essential to our mandate as the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), and we recognize that the value of our data will be optimized when they are easily found, readily available, and have multiple purposes.</p>
									<img src="images/Vision 1.png" class="img left" alt="A graphic illustrating the components of quality data.">
									<p>Our need for, and the availability of timely data will continue to grow exponentially in the years ahead.Technology is advancing rapidly, creating unprecedented opportunities to integrate machine learning and artificial intelligence into science-based analytics that will improve our ability to generate predictive models for important public health outcomes. There is also a growing expectation for real-time data that informs analysis for timely decisions. The Agency is increasingly combining innovative data analytics and visualization tools with traditional epidemiologic research and surveillance methods, transforming our data rich environment into meaningful public health information. This is enabling us to learn more about our public health ecosystem and about public policies so that we can support all Canadians in achieving optimal health and reduce health disparities in key populations across the country. Of course, and importantly, these advancements are closely made with a deep understanding that Canadians expect more of their governments to safeguard privacy.</p>
									<p>These are the drivers behind the Public Health Agency of Canada’s first Data Strategy. This strategy is designed to be both aspirational and practical. Delivering on the strategy will enable us to build a foundation for public health data.</p>
									<p>Informing our Data Strategy are consultations with over 500 PHAC employees from across the country. And importantly, it is paired with an Implementation Plan so that our aspirations are put into action.</p>
									<p>When fully realized, the implementation plan will establish clear governance, develop horizontal data infrastructure, adopt innovative approaches, encourage iterative experimentation, prioritize users, and forge partnerships with jurisdictions and external organizations. And foundational to all of this is recognition that our culture must support our staff's development and need for tools and resources so that they can continue to excel at being the fabric of our federal public health organization.</p>
									<p>Through the actions in this PHAC Data Strategy, we aspire to be an Agency that leverages data innovations and modern technical capacity in pursuit of our mandate to promote and protect the health of Canadians.</p>

									</div>
									<br>
								<img src="images/Data Landscape Blue.png" class="img-fluid" alt="a design of people in a city with the word data floating in the sky. The 'A' is being lifted by a helicopter.">
								<p>Data are the raw ingredient for surveillance, evidence, research and science. Data play a key role in informing interventions and policy decisions, and supporting core public health functions. Data inform evaluation, performance information, and results-based management of PHAC’s programs and initiatives. Data contribute to knowledge translation, education, and public health information that is tailored for, and disseminated to, Canadians.</p>
								<p>At their most basic, raw data are numbers, readings, and figures collected from a source. Data play a significant structural role in scientific organizations, providing the essential measurements and observations that guide our research, propel our analyses, and inform our decisions. At PHAC, our goal is to use data to promote and protect the health of Canadians.</p>
								<p>Innovation and collaboration can be catalysts in this transformative process: from data, to public health information and evidence, to informed decision-making.</p>
								<p>However, the data transformation process is far from being this simple due to the complexity of our landscape. Our public health governance and systems are comprised of multiple stakeholders, some with shared legislative responsibilities (between federal and provincial jurisdictions), and some with different priorities. Furthermore, public health outcomes have multifactorial causes that can be difficult to assess and address comprehensively without a unified interdisciplinary approach.</p>
								<p>An abundance of organizations have important data sources to inform decision-making for a number of social determinants of health. Nonetheless, if we are able to more easily identify, integrate and interpret all relevant data sources (propelled by innovation and collaboration), we can influence changes that seek to reduce health disparities.</p>
								<p>At PHAC, we use data to produce a view of population health across Canada. Data linkages are necessary to maximize the value of information as well as extend its reach to social determinants of health. When used well, data provide much-needed national perspectives on everything from foodborne illnesses, to chronic diseases, to health surveillance programs. Data can also give us feedback on the impact of our leadership, services, and health promotion initiatives.</p>
								<p>In addition, the landscape in which we navigate is further characterized by uncertainty stemming from risks of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, including those caused by antimicrobial resistance and climate change. In order to be prepared for these and other future unknowns, a structure that unleashes the power of data coming from a multitude of sources is necessary. This will require strengthening our commitment to innovation in data analytics and technology (including artificial intelligence and machine learning), as well as fostering strategic partnerships to solve old, new and future public health problems. In doing so, we can enhance PHAC's work in disease detection, cessation, prevention, and control - to ultimately keep Canadians healthy.</p>

									<h4 class="video-title">Animation Video</h4>
									<p>PHAC produces, collects and disseminates a wide range of public health data – this includes data for its many surveillance programs that monitor infectious and chronic diseases, and other emerging public health events.</p>
									<img src="images/Problematique.png" class="img right" alt="A graphic representing PHAC's collection and dissemination of data.">			
									<p>Despite the high-quality data and analyses generated by PHAC programs, our overarching approach to data management remains <span style="font-weight:bold;">fragmented</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold;">inconsistent</span>. Looking at data from an Agency-wide perspective, it is not clear what data is held collectively, and what can be accessed by employees. Similarly, it’s hard to identify the Agency's data priorities to inform decision-making and action. When we approach our partners (including provinces and territories, Statistics Canada or the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI)) about our data or surveillance priorities, we do so as individual programs and not as a unified federal entity.</p>
									<p>Branch by branch, public health data are collected through many different channels, stored on different mediums, analysed using different methods, and disseminated in different ways. These challenges reduce PHAC’s capacity to fulfill our mandate, especially given the heightened importance of interdisciplinary work in public health. Consequently, our reputation as a trusted source of public health information is at risk.</p>
									<p>When our staff are asked about the data innovations they’d like to see, they often cannot get past the daily obstacles they face to do their regular data analysis and their ongoing IT-related challenges – let alone determining opportunities for innovation.We have accepted work-arounds and band-aid solutions as the norm to overcome our data infrastructure and data analytics challenges. And where innovative best practices exist within PHAC, as well as from other groups and jurisdictions, they are not shared or scaled-up Agency-wide.</p>
									<p>Collectively, we recognize our challenges. This is emphasized in the PHAC Corporate Risk Profile, whereby we state: “There is a risk that, as the volume of and need for public health data increases both domestically and internationally, PHAC may not have access to timely, reliable and accurate information and/or data nor the ability to undertake the necessary data analysis, which could reduce effective evidence-based decision-making pertaining to public health matters.”</p>
									<p>These challenges weaken PHAC’s capacity to fulfill our mandate. For example, while we may collect an impressive amount of data, little is done in the way of data integration between disciplines such as chronic and infectious diseases, as well as between social and economic determinants of health. This can only be achieved through fostering effective partnerships and leveraging novel technologies to create more opportunities for data innovation. Furthermore, our dispersed data and data accountability structures have undeniably lead us to miss opportunities to extract greater public health insights. This reality has made it difficult for us to realize our commitment in the PHAC Strategic Plan: “release timely and interactive data and high-quality analysis to support decision making and action.”</p>
									<blockquote style="font-style: italic;">"Public health is still struggling to catch up to the potential for effective surveillance afforded by new technologies. ... progress has been too slow and ‘stovepipe’ systems persist everywhere." (Naylor, 2003)</blockquote> 
									<p>At the heart of “Learning from SARS”, otherwise known as the Naylor report, were recommendations relating to information infrastructure identifying the need for information architecture, models and standards, technology transfer, privacy and information management, development of data sources and system development.</p>
									<p>Changing our data culture represents an organizational transformation and will require careful, determined, strategic leadership and long-term investments in order to enhance PHAC’s data management capabilities, technical infrastructure and analytic resources.</p>
									<p>This Data Strategy is our opportunity to set a new path forward in how we approach data. By establishing clear governance, developing horizontal data infrastructure, adopting innovative approaches, encouraging experimentation, putting users at the centre of our efforts, and forging partnerships with jurisdictions and external organizations, we can ensure that PHAC has a clear and consistent approach to data management that supports decision-making and action.</p>

								<p>To develop the Data Strategy, PHAC took a “top-down” and “bottom-up” approach. While the Agency’s Executive Committee (EC) approved the overall scope of the strategy via the “Six Themes,” and the engagement approach, the contents of the strategy and the implementation plan are a result of direct engagement with staff - from all branches, regions, groups and levels.</p>
								<p>Staff were engaged in one of two ways:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Through a series of open workshops centered on the six core themes of the Strategy. Participation was both in-person and remote (phone and video) to be inclusive of all geographic regions of the Agency. During the workshops, staff shared their experiences about how data are currently being used within PHAC, what challenges they’ve faced in collecting and using data, and what solutions may address the gaps; and,</li>
									<li>Through over twenty targeted consultations with key committees and groups, including groups such as the Privacy Management Division, Audit and Evaluation, the Surveillance Integration Team, and tier two Governance Committees (Policy and Operations). Furthermore, the PHAC data hub had conversations with each branch executive team within PHAC to learn about their needs and expectations for the Data Strategy.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>This broad consultation approach ensured that areas of expertise specific to data informed the scope of the strategy - and inclusive of PHAC’s program areas, laboratory sciences, as well as evaluation and results-based management. By the end of the 6-month consultation period, over 25% of PHAC’s employees attended and contributed to one or more of the consultation sessions.</p>
								<p>The PHAC data hub also committed to <span style="font-weight:bolder;">working in the open</span> during the process. Summaries and notes were sent for validation and then posted for others to read. For a full list of consultations, and the notes from all of the sessions conducted by the Data Hub, visit the PHAC Data Strategy page on GCCollab, <a href="https://gccollab.ca/groups/profile/1801344/entrue-story-a-data-strategy-for-public-healthfr">True Story: A Data Strategy for Public Health</a>.</p>

								<h4 class="video-title">Intro:</h4>
								<p>From March 2019 to July 2019, we, a team within the PHAC Data, Partnerships and Innovation Hub, consulted with over 500 PHAC employees. Time after time, we heard from PHAC staff that the value of our data will be optimized when it is easily found, readily available, and have multiple applications for our public health functions. We also heard PHAC’s data culture described as a collection of “independent islands,” with plenty of opportunities to share resources, best practices, and data standards. The most common solution proposed for this was horizontal collaboration, integration, and leadership on data initiatives. Overall, there was a widespread desire to get on the same page in order to streamline and rationalize the bespoke processes currently in place to all elements of the data lifecycle.</p>

											<h3 class="carousel-title">Data Governance</h4>
											<p>The data hub's consultations uncovered many different needs across the Agency, yet overarching was the need for horizontal collaboration, integration, and leadership.</p>
											<p>This need was often expressed in-and-through the use of the word “common.” We heard calls for common language, definitions, principles, and tools; “a common understanding of risk” and a “common approach to data sharing agreements.”</p>
											<p>Other comments advocated the need for enterprise solutions to common problems like data infrastructure, data literacy training, and process design. To many, the role of a Chief Data Officer was seen as an appropriate way to delegate responsibilities, and to distribute resources and support.</p>
											<p>Thematically, comments from the consultation focused around the idea that processes that are accessible and consistent would empower employees to find solutions to their data needs and to develop new areas of inquiry. For many, successful data governance would mean a shared understanding at PHAC of how to acquire and manage data, and governance that can be navigated efficiently by employees.</p>

											<h3 class="carousel-title">Data as an Asset</h4>
											<p>In our consultations, we heard PHAC data described as siloed and project-specific. As an organization, PHAC was described as a collection of “independent islands,” sharing little in the way of resources, best practices, data standards, and so on.</p>
											<p>Branch-by-branch, data are collected in different ways for different purposes under different agreements. Data are often used for their initial purpose then never used again.</p>
											<p>The consequence is that we lack the ability to make general use of our data and we don’t know what data the organization has (discoverability). As one respondent noted, this can result in inequalities: “without a comprehensive view of our data we cannot identify gaps, resulting in certain areas that lack attention” (examples given were oral health, chronic pain, and eye care). If we want to use our data to make improvements to the overall health of Canadians, then horizontal collaboration is key.</p>
											<p>Throughout the consultations we also heard appeals for clear and common standards, processes, and best practices to data collection, storage, access, use and dissemination. Participants generally viewed treating data as an asset meant viewing PHAC’s data holdings as a resource that can be used to improve the performance and quality of public health initiatives across the Agency.</p>

										<div class="carousel-item">
											<h3 class="carousel-title">Science-based Analytics</h4>
											<p>During our consultations we wanted to learn about what kind of advanced and innovative analytics could be done with public health data. We know that data can provide us with powerful predictive insights, from early detection of infectious disease outbreaks, to predictions of individual risk, to chronic illnesses.</p>
											<p>Our "'future state' should include virtual machines, layering data points (geo-mapping), social media networking (spread through contact), modelling, and cloud computing."</p>
											<p>What we heard, however, was that our capacity to collect, manage, and use data does not support new or innovative uses. Many respondents cautioned that before we make investments into new technologies, we need to ensure that we achieve a sufficient baseline efficacy."Innovation is nice," one respondent noted, "but I just want the basics to work."</p>
											<p>We also need to change the way that we work, focusing less on using restricted data to produce static (mostly textual) reports, to providing the public with real-time, open, and visual communications of what we do.</p>
											<p>"[It] used to be more flexible to play [with the data], but now there are several layers of security, limits to access, too many rules, forms, and meetings. The process is burdensome. In a real environment, you should just be able to do things."</p>

										</div>
										<div class="carousel-item">
											<h3 class="carousel-title">Data Infrastructure</h4>
											<p>During our consultations we heard an urgent cry for better data infrastructure. One respondent put it bluntly: “the bare minimum we need to do our job is not being met.”</p>
											<p>There was a sense that technology is often working against us, adding layers of complexity, redundancy, and providing limited space and access. Many people felt that they spent most of their time putting out fires, waiting for software, or finding workarounds to problems that technology was supposed to solve.</p>
											<p>Respondents spoke of the huge impact that access and control over data infrastructure can have on public health research. Researchers spoke about the potential of experimenting with cloud computing to reduce the cost of running genomic applications. The problem for our current infrastructure is the less than agency-wide adoption of cloud computing and related tools like virtual machines, geo-mapping, social media analysis, and modelling. Simply put, cutting-edge public health research and experimental science are difficult to perform when you don't have control over your own equipment.</p>

										</div>
										<div class="carousel-item">
											<h3 class="carousel-title">Partnerships and Collaboration</h4>
											<p>Partnerships are essential to PHAC's mandate. We are the primary bridge between provinces, territories, academics, nonprofits, the private sector, and the international public health community. For this reason, the challenges we face have an immediate impact on our performance.</p>
											<p>One of the main challenges we heard revolved around issues of trust. In short, partners don't want to share their data with PHAC if we cannot demonstrate leadership - or even a single “whole of Agency approach” - in the collection, management, and use of data.</p>
											<p>We also heard about process challenges. We rely on data from outside sources, yet there are “no standardized processes with regards to agreements and contracts.” Contracts and negotiations are time-consuming: it can take “one year prep time for a two year contract.” When we do receive data, they often lack standardization.</p>
											<p>The value of partnerships can be demonstrated through consistent and responsive processes that can be relied upon by our partners. Our relationships with PTs have the potential for robust data sharing, but we heard that past attempts have not proceeded as desired. Ultimately, PHAC will need a very strong value proposition to set the foundation for effective partnerships with our PT counterparts so that everyone is a willing participant at the table.</p>
											<p>When asked to look into the future, a consensus emerged on the potential for improvements through a unified approach to partnerships. Respondents generally agreed that a standardization ofapproach within PHAC to partnerships would empower PHAC to coordinate our engagement in line with each partner’s capacity.</p>
											<p>As one participant clearly summarized, we need to “…identify and articulate what we’re going to bring into the partnership, be clear on what it is that we are able to provide in a two-way relationship, and to articulate PHAC’s value proposition to partners.”</p>
											<p>For more feedback we heard from staff, visit the PHAC Data Strategy page on GCCollab, <a href="https://gccollab.ca/groups/profile/1801344/entrue-story-a-data-strategy-for-public-healthfr">True Story: A Data Strategy for Public Health</a>.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="carousel-item">
											<h3 class="carousel-title">People and Culture</h4>
											<p>Data and technology drive the public health system. During our consultations we heard about how data can inform everything from our response to health emergencies to the design of our health promotional materials or our understanding of health disparities. This is obviously an area where innovation is possible, and respondents described countless examples where digital tools helped PHAC collaborate with partners, interact and visualize data, and develop new strategies for success.</p>
											<p>These success stories emphasised that data is used in virtually every area of PHAC, and that improving the data culture at the Agency would have broad-based positive impacts in nearly every activity and program area. It also highlighted the diversity of approaches that employees are using, creating the Agency’s current data culture.</p>
											<p>The challenge is to integrate theses cultures and tools to empower employees to do more with data. However, it is difficult to use data and adopt new tools in an environment that is risk averse, siloed, and slowed down by inefficient processes.</p>
											<p>While it is possible for individuals to work around these challenges, it is clear from our consultations that measurable and incremental changes require a cultural shift. This shift is about “ensuring that people have the skills to collect the data” and recognizing every public servant as a ‘data agent’: capable of managing and drawing on data to make better decisions.</p>

								<p>PHAC produces, collects and disseminates a wide range of public health data – this includes data for its many surveillance programs that monitor infectious and chronic diseases, and other emerging public health events.</p>
								<p>Despite the high-quality data and analyses generated by PHAC programs, our overarching approach to data management remains fragmented and inconsistent. Looking at data from an Agency-wide perspective, it is not clear what data is held collectively, and what can be accessed by employees. Similarly, it’s hard to identify the Agency's data priorities to inform decision-making and action. When we approach our partners (including provinces and territories, Statistics Canada or the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI)) about our data or surveillance priorities, we do so as individual programs and not as a unified federal entity.</p>
								<p>These challenges reduces PHAC’s capacity to fulfill our mandate, especially given the interdisciplinary nature of the field of public health. For example, the need for a comprehensive understanding of linkages across chronic and infectious diseases is necessary as we foster these partnerships and tap into more opportunities for innovation. Our dispersed data accountability structure prohibits maximization of the value from our data, making it difficult to evaluate the impact and efficiency of our collective efforts in achieving important organizational goals. When our staff are asked about the data innovations they’d like to see, they often cannot get past the daily obstacles they face to do basic data analysis – let alone anything innovative.  We have accepted work-arounds and band-aid solutions as the norm to overcome our data infrastructure and data analytics challenges – much to the chagrin of our data providers and partners. And where innovative best practices exist within PHAC, as well as from other groups and jurisdictions, they are not shared or scaled-up Agency-wide.</p>
								<p>Branch by branch, public health data are collected through many different channels, stored on different mediums, analysed using different methods, and disseminated in different ways. These challenges reduce PHAC’s capacity to fulfill our mandate, especially given the heightened importance of interdisciplinary work in public health. What’s at stake? Our reputation as a trusted source of public health information.</p>

									<p>Data are the raw ingredient for surveillance, evidence, research and science. Data play a key role in informing interventions and policy decisions, and supporting core public health functions. Data inform evaluation, performance information, and results-based management of PHAC’s programs and initiatives. Data contributes to knowledge translation, education, and public health information that is tailored and disseminated for Canadians.</p>
									<p>The current PHAC data culture is characterized by data planning, acquisition, collection, and management activities dispersed across branches and focused on meeting individual program needs in a classic siloed approach to data. The siloed approach to data culture has benefits as well as challenges. The benefits include strong collaboration and partnerships with external data providers established by individual programs and data management procedures tailored to program needs. The challenges occur as a result of incongruent approaches for data management, in some cases a lack of formal data sharing agreements, no systematic data profile for PHAC’s health data holdings as well as a broad range of independent, incompatible data structures and technology.</p>
									<p>In addition to these challenges, the major change in how the federal government approaches the management of information technology through the creation of Shared Services Canada (SSC), has led some departments to be vocal with regard to how this change has impacted on their ability to successfully execute their mandates. We will need to work with SSC to break through technological barriers facing our staff.</p>
									<p>This is our opportunity to set a new path forward in how we approach data. By establishing clear governance, developing horizontal data infrastructure, adopting innovative approaches, encouraging experimentation, putting users at the centre of our efforts, and forging partnerships with jurisdictions and external organizations, we can ensure that PHAC has a clear and consistent approach to data management that supports decision-making and action. The Data Strategy intends to bring PHAC leaders together and data holders from all fields to better serve Canadians.</p>
									<p>Making change in PHAC’s data culture represents an organizational transformation and will require careful, determined, strategic leadership and long-term investments in order to improve PHAC’s data management capabilities, technical infrastructure and analytic resources, including human resources.

									<p>The Data Strategy is the umbrella for all policies, frameworks, guidance, standards and practices that are required to ensure that data are managed and used as an asset. While there are existing policies, rules, standards, and practices that exist in some shape or form ( and others that will need to be refreshed or newly developed), the Data Strategy provides the outline for a comprehensive vision for PHAC: it sets the direction going forward, focuses our efforts and provides a coherent plan for governing, analyzing and deploying all data related to achieving public health outcomes.</p>
									<p>The follwoing principles will help drive the emergence of a common data culture at PHAC:</p>
									<img src="images/Principles.png" class="img right" alt="We are one agency, we manage public health data as an asset, and we are enabled and empowered by our technical infrastructure.">			
									<p>1. We Are One Agency: No external party needs to understand the structure of the Agency to do business with us. We meet our partners with a united voice with well-defined channels for establishing agreements and sharing data.</p>
									<p>2. We Manage Public Health Data as an Asset: We treat data like an essential tool. Our data can be leveraged, reused, shared and built upon. We do this carefully and expertly, through shared standards and best practices, and in collaboration with provincial and territorial partners, the public health community, and the general public.</p>
									<p>3. We Are Enabled and Empowered by Our Technical Infrastructure: Our technical infrastructure facilitates data collection, enhancement, and analyses. With few exceptions, business decisions about what data to collect, preserve, use or disseminate are not decided by technical limitations.</p>
