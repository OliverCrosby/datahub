								<p>Data are the raw ingredient for surveillance, evidence, research and science. Data play a key role in informing interventions and policy decisions, and supporting core public health functions. Data inform evaluation, performance information, and results-based management of PHAC’s programs and initiatives. Data contributes to knowledge translation, education, and public health information that is tailored and disseminated for Canadians.</p>
								<p>The current PHAC data culture is characterized by data planning, acquisition, collection, and management activities dispersed across branches and focused on meeting individual program needs in a classic siloed approach to data. The siloed approach to data culture has benefits as well as challenges. The benefits include strong collaboration and partnerships with external data providers established by individual programs and data management procedures tailored to program needs. The challenges occur as a result of incongruent approaches for data management, in some cases a lack of formal data sharing agreements, no systematic data profile for PHAC’s health data holdings as well as a broad range of independent, incompatible data structures and technology.</p>
								<p>In addition to these challenges, the major change in how the federal government approaches the management of information technology through the creation of Shared Services Canada (SSC), has led some departments to be vocal with regard to how this change has impacted on their ability to successfully execute their mandates. We will need to work with SSC to break through technological barriers facing our staff.</p>
								<p>This is our opportunity to set a new path forward in how we approach data. By establishing clear governance, developing horizontal data infrastructure, adopting innovative approaches, encouraging experimentation, putting users at the centre of our efforts, and forging partnerships with jurisdictions and external organizations, we can ensure that PHAC has a clear and consistent approach to data management that supports decision-making and action. The Data Strategy intends to bring PHAC leaders together and data holders from all fields to better serve Canadians.</p>
								<p>Making change in PHAC’s data culture represents an organizational transformation and will require careful, determined, strategic leadership and long-term investments in order to improve PHAC’s data management capabilities, technical infrastructure and analytic resources, including human resources.

								<p>PHAC produces, collects and disseminates a wide range of public health data – this includes data for its many surveillance programs that monitor infectious and chronic diseases, and other emerging public health events.</p>
								<p>Despite the high-quality data and analyses generated by PHAC programs, our overarching approach to data management remains fragmented and inconsistent. Looking at data from an Agency-wide perspective, it is not clear what data is held collectively, and what can be accessed by employees. Similarly, it’s hard to identify the Agency's data priorities to inform decision-making and action. When we approach our partners (including provinces and territories, Statistics Canada or the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI)) about our data or surveillance priorities, we do so as individual programs and not as a unified federal entity.</p>
								<p>These challenges reduces PHAC’s capacity to fulfill our mandate, especially given the interdisciplinary nature of the field of public health. For example, the need for a comprehensive understanding of linkages across chronic and infectious diseases is necessary as we foster these partnerships and tap into more opportunities for innovation. Our dispersed data accountability structure prohibits maximization of the value from our data, making it difficult to evaluate the impact and efficiency of our collective efforts in achieving important organizational goals. When our staff are asked about the data innovations they’d like to see, they often cannot get past the daily obstacles they face to do basic data analysis – let alone anything innovative.  We have accepted work-arounds and band-aid solutions as the norm to overcome our data infrastructure and data analytics challenges – much to the chagrin of our data providers and partners. And where innovative best practices exist within PHAC, as well as from other groups and jurisdictions, they are not shared or scaled-up Agency-wide.</p>
								<p>Branch by branch, public health data are collected through many different channels, stored on different mediums, analysed using different methods, and disseminated in different ways. These challenges reduce PHAC’s capacity to fulfill our mandate, especially given the heightened importance of interdisciplinary work in public health. What’s at stake? Our reputation as a trusted source of public health information.</p>

When we approach our partners (including provinces and territories, Statistics Canada or the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI)) about our data or surveillance priorities, we do so as individual programs and not as a unified federal entity.</p>
									<p>These challenges reduces PHAC’s capacity to fulfill our mandate, especially given the interdisciplinary nature of the field of public health. For example, the need for a comprehensive understanding of linkages across chronic and infectious diseases is necessary as we foster these partnerships and tap into more opportunities for innovation. Our dispersed data accountability structure prohibits maximization of the value from our data, making it difficult to evaluate the impact and efficiency of our collective efforts in achieving important organizational goals. When our staff are asked about the data innovations they’d like to see, they often cannot get past the daily obstacles they face to do basic data analysis – let alone anything innovative.  We have accepted work-arounds and band-aid solutions as the norm to overcome our data infrastructure and data analytics challenges – much to the chagrin of our data providers and partners. And where innovative best practices exist within PHAC, as well as from other groups and jurisdictions, they are not shared or scaled-up Agency-wide.</p>
									<p>Branch by branch, public health data are collected through many different channels, stored on different mediums, analysed using different methods, and disseminated in different ways. These challenges reduce PHAC’s capacity to fulfill our mandate, especially given the heightened importance of interdisciplinary work in public health. What’s at stake? Our reputation as a trusted source of public health information.</p>

									<p>Data are the raw ingredient for surveillance, evidence, research and science. Data play a key role in informing interventions and policy decisions, and supporting core public health functions. Data inform evaluation, performance information, and results-based management of PHAC’s programs and initiatives. Data contributes to knowledge translation, education, and public health information that is tailored and disseminated for Canadians.</p>
									<p>Innovation and collaboration can be catalysts in this transformative process: from data, to public health information and evidence, to informed decision-making.</p>
									<p>However, it is far from being this simple due to the complexity of our landscape. Our public health governance and systems are comprised of multiple stakeholders, some with shared legislative responsibilities (between federal and provincial jurisdictions), and some with different priorities. Furthermore, public health outcomes have multifactorial causes that can be difficult to assess and address comprehensively without a unified interdisciplinary approach.</p>
									<p>An abundance of organizations have important data sources to inform decision-making in a number of social determinants of health. Nonetheless, if we are able to more easily identify, integrate and interpret all relevant data sources (propelled by innovation and collaboration), we can influence changes to reduce health disparities.</p>
									<p>In addition, the landscape in which we navigate is further characterized by uncertainty stemming from risks of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, including those caused by antimicrobial resistance and climate change. In order to be prepared for these and other future unknowns, a structure that unleashes the power of data coming from a multitude of sources is necessary. This will require strengthening our commitment to innovation in data analytics and technology (including artificial intelligence and machine learning), as well as fostering strategic partnerships to solve old, new and future public health problems. In doing so, we can enhance PHAC's work in disease detection, cessation, prevention, and control - to ultimately keep Canadians healthy.</p>
